Map coloring and sudoku problems
Implement the algorithm using backtracking, backtracking with forward checking, backtracking with AC-3, and min-conflicts.

Implement the backtracking search with 
1. degree heuristic, 
2. least-constraining-value, 
3. minimum-remaining-values. 

Also, evaluate the different implementations with the map of the entire USA and the Sudoku puzzle.
